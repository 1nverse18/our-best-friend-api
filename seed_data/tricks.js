As soon as your dog paws at your hand, click/praise, open your hand, and give the treat. Repeat the above step several times until your dog is consistently pawing at your hand. Once your dog is consistently pawing your hand, start building the duration and increasing the difficulty. Have your dog hold their paw on your hand for slightly longer before you praise/click and treat.',
